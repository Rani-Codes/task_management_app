# task_management_app

A task management application with a CRUD-based RESTful API

A note on my thought process: I was watching a video on routing and noticed that the guide was compartmentalizing his routes into three parts; controller, queries, and routes files. This way seemed much cleaner to read so I decided to follow his lead. This is probably not needed for a project like this but I feel like it is a good thing to get in the habit of doing so I will continue to do it for the rest of the project.
